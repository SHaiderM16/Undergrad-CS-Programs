# Programming Assignments

This repository contains programming assignments from my undergraduate Computer Science studies. These assignments showcase my growth as a programmer and cover fundamental programming skills, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and assembly language concepts.

## Contents

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Algorithms, file handling, and memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: 
  - **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree), heaps, graphs, and hashing.
  - **Algorithms**: Searching (linear, binary, string searching), sorting (e.g., bubble sort), and other algorithmic techniques.
- **Computer Organization and Assembly Language**: Programs demonstrating low-level concepts such as arithmetic operations, recursive procedures, array manipulation, string processing, and pattern generation, using the Irvine32 library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository with:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SHaiderM16/Undergrad-CS-Programs.git
    ```

2. Browse the folders to explore the assignments.
