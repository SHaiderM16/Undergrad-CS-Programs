# Programming Assignments

This repository contains programming assignments from my undergraduate Computer Science studies. These assignments showcase my growth as a programmer and cover fundamental programming skills, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and assembly language concepts.

## Contents

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Algorithms, file handling, and memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Linear and non-linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs), sorting algorithms, and search techniques.
- **Computer Organization and Assembly Language**: Assembly-level programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, memory management, and system-level interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository with:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Browse the folders to explore the assignments.
